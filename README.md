# Plushie Test :3

A mod I made to add some plushies to Minecraft 1.20.1 using Forge, they squeak :3

Thanks, Nova for the models and textures.

## Installation

Install Minecraft Forge 1.20.1, download the latest release, and drop the jar file into the mods folder of your .minecraft directory.

## Dependencies

This mod uses [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [Geckolib4](https://modrinth.com/mod/geckolib) so make sure you have them installed as well

## Contributing

If you encounter any weird bugs with the plushies please open an issue ticket, thanks :3
