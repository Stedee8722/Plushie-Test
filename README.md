# Plushie Test :3

A mod I made to add some plushies to Minecraft 1.20.1 using Forge, they squeak :3

Thanks, Nova for the models and textures.

## Installation

Install Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 and drop the zip file into the mods folder of your .minecraft directory... Wait I didn't build it yet, whoops.

## Contributing

If you encounter any weird bugs with the plushies please open an issue ticket, thanks :3
